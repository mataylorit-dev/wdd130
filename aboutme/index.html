<h2>About Me</h2> <p>Hi Eveyone! I'm currently a cybersecurity major at BYU-Idaho, and I work in the IT department of a school district here, which is very fun. I'm primarily responsible for their network, but we are district-wide, so I have other responsibilities as well. I love the IT field beacuse of the variety of things I get to do. I have 5 younger siblings, three younger brothers, and then two little sisters. I live in Rexburg, and It's very safe and nice, except for the cold winters when it is below zero.</p> 
<p>I have three younger brothers and two little sisters. I enjoy working with IT infastricture, especially large-scale networks. I also enjoy being outdoors, but I'm not a gamer, maybe if I find some games that are interesting, I'll get into it, but I simply haven't looked in a while... </p> <p> I served my mission in California, beginning in the California Sacramento Mission, and then halfway in, there was a mission split, and the California Modesto Mission was created, and the bottom three stakes from the Sacramento mission were combined with the top three of the Fresno Mission. Very grateful for my mission and all the people I was able to know and be with.  </p> <p> I am looking forward to learning more about web design, and how I can apply it to myself.  </p> </body>

    <h3>Why we do what we do: </h3>
    <p>
      East Idaho is growing at record rates, and with that continued growth comes the need for better and more reliable networks. Whether you are a school, a resort, or a buisness, you need a network that is fast, reliable, and secure. Many buisnesses lost many hundreds of hours in productivity due to unreliable networks. At Delta Networks we specialize in designing, deploying, and maintaining networks that perform at thier peak for buisnesses and organizations of all sizes.
    </p>
    <h3>Success Stories</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Every company has different network needs. We work with you to design a solution that fits your needs and budget. Whether you need a simple network for a small office, or a complex network for a large campus, we have the expertise to deliver a solution that meets your requirements.

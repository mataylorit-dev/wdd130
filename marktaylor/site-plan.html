                ConnectIT Managed Services

                Network Management

                MDM/User Accounts

                Passpoint Wi-Fi

                iOS Apps

                There are a few ways we can add value to your buisness. Here are a few of the services we offer:

                1. Google Orion Passpoint.

                We can manage your network, and implement a carrier Passpoint network, which will make YOU & your company money based on how many guests connect and use your network. How does this work you may ask? We set up your business to host its existing wireless networks, and we add a special kind of network that will securely authenticate guests that stop by your business. The guests are securely authenticated via a certificate through their carrier, and the carriers then pay you per gigabyte of data transmitted over your network. It’s truly a win-win. You win, because you have a guest network that is secure, and makes you money each month, with no cost to deploy. Your customers win, because they are able to have a great wireless experience in your facility, and the carriers win, because rather than pay many thousands of dollars to set up cell towers, they can pay businesses to provide coverage.

                2. Managed User Accounts

                Another technology we can add is managed user account creation and maintenance. Many small business owners set up many laptops as personal devices and give out the password to employees. This is super insecure, and there is very little room for accountability or data protection. Some want to have individual user accounts for employees but are not big enough where it makes financial sense to hire a team. That’s where we come in. We can set up what is called “Active Directory.” Active Directory, or AD allows all users to be centrally managed on a local server, and then any user on a computer attached to the server will be able to sign in and have the same permissions on each work computer they sign into. We also support the creation and maintenance of corporate email accounts for you and your employees. This service allows a growing organization to more easily secure company data and have email groups for different employees. We currently support corporate Google Accounts, as well as Microsoft Outlook accounts. We can also manage office licenses as well as provide discounted product keys.

                3. Mobile Device Management (MDM)

                MDM control: If you are a medium-size business, you may have iOS and Android devices that you want to securely manage and track if they were ever lost. Many organizations start off not controlling the devices that they own, and with time, have to deal with Apple Activation Lock as well as Google’s own find my device lock. This can be an issue, because you now have to track down former employees to unlock your devices. MDM allows the devices to be managed with streamlined customizations that you choose for your business, and restrict access to things like web browsing.

                4. Custom iOS Apps

                We can develop iOS apps to meet the needs of your buisness. BetterCal is an examle of what we have created, and it had has been well recived among its target user base. Reach out for for more information.

            <h3>BetterCal iOS App</h3>
            <p>
                BetterCal for iOS - ConnectIT Corp is proud to announce the release of our first iOS application, BetterCal. BetterCal first became a thought after my mission for my church, when myself and other returned missionaries wanted a planner that would behave like the Church's Preach my Gospel App. It has been in testing on TestFlight, with over 100 users in the first week of being out. It mainly is a calendar application that allows users to easily manage their schedules, set reminders, and sync with other calendar services. The app features a clean and intuitive interface which allows them to drag and drop events, associate events with contacts, and have a running reports of all of them under the contact view. Another significant feature is the ability to view all of your contacts and events on a map, so you can visualise your day on a map. All users data is synchronized with Google firebase, and supports Sign in with Google or Apple.

                    <h2>BetterCal iOS App Development</h2>
                    <p>Many recently returned missionaries want a planner that resembles the PMG (Preach my Gospel App). We have turned that into reality with the launch of BetterCal, which allows its users to report on their day with more precision and exactness. It has been in testing on TestFlight, with over 100 users in the first week of being out. It mainly is a calendar application that allows users to easily manage their schedules, set reminders, and sync with other calendar services.</p>
                    <p>BetterCal features a clean and intuitive interface which allows the user to drag and drop events, associate events with contacts, and have a running reports of all of them under the contact view. Another significant feature is the ability to view all of your contacts and events on a map, so you can visualize your day on a map. All user data is synchronized with Google Firebase, and supports Sign in with Google or Apple. Incredible customization also exists with repeat times, colors, and icons.</p>

                    <h2>Map View Feature</h2>
                    <p>One of the most compelling features of BetterCal is the map view, which allows users to visualize all of their events and contacts for the day geographically. This innovative approach to calendar management helps users understand the spatial relationship between their commitments, making it easier to plan their day and optimize their time. The map view integrates seamlessly with BetterCal's contact management system, showing both event locations and contact addresses in one comprehensive view.</p>

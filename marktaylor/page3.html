        <p>Many recently returned missionares want a planner that resembles the PMG (Preach my Gospel App) We have turned thta into reality with the launch of BetterCal, which allows its users to report on thier day with more precision and exactness. It has been in testing on TestFlight, with over 100 users in the first week of being out. It mainly is a calendar application that allows users to easily manage their schedules, set reminders, and sync with other calendar services. BetterCal features a clean and intuitive interface which allows the user to drag and drop events, associate events with contacts, and have a running reports of all of them under the contact view. Another significant feature is the ability to view all of your contacts and events on a map, so you can visualise your day on a map. All users data is synchronized with Google firebase, and supports Sign in with Google or Apple. Shown below is a view of the "Map view" which shows all of a users's events for the day, as well as their contacts. Incredible customization also exists with repeat times, colors, and icons.  </p>

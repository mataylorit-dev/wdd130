            <h2>There are a few ways we can add value to your buisness. Here are a few of the services we offer:</h2>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Google Orion Passpoint.</h2>
                <p>We can manage your network, and implement Google’s Orion Passpoint network, which will make YOU & your company money based on how many guests connect and use your network. How does this work you may ask? We set up your business to host its existing wireless networks, and we add a special kind of network that will securely authenticate guests that stop by your business. The guests are securely authenticated via a certificate through their carrier, and the carriers then pay you per gigabyte of data transmitted over your network. It’s truly a win-win. You win, because you have a guest network that is secure, and makes you money each month, with no cost to deploy. Your customers win, because they are able to have a great wireless experience in your facility, and the carriers win, because rather than pay many thousands of dollars to set up cell towers, they can pay businesses to provide coverage.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Managed User Accounts</h2>
                <p>Another technology we can add is managed user account creation and maintenance. Many small business owners set up many laptops as personal devices and give out the password to employees. This is super insecure, and there is very little room for accountability or data protection. Some want to have individual user accounts for employees but are not big enough where it makes financial sense to hire a team. That’s where we come in. We can set up what is called “Active Directory.” Active Directory, or AD allows all users to be centrally managed on a local server, and then any user on a computer attached to the server will be able to sign in and have the same permissions on each work computer they sign into.</p>

                <p>We also support the creation and maintenance of corporate email accounts for you and your employees. This service allows a growing organization to more easily secure company data and have email groups for different employees. We currently support corporate Google Accounts, as well as Microsoft Outlook accounts. We can also manage office licenses as well as provide discounted product keys.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Mobile Device Management (MDM)</h2>
                <p>MDM control: If you are a medium-size business, you may have iOS and Android devices that you want to securely manage and track if they were ever lost. Many organizations start off not controlling the devices that they own, and with time, have to deal with Apple Activation Lock as well as Google’s own find my device lock. This can be an issue, because you now have to track down former employees to unlock your devices. MDM allows the devices to be managed with streamlined customizations that you choose for your business, and restrict access to things like web browsing.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Custom iOS Apps</h2>
                <p>We can develop iOS apps to meet the needs of your buisness. BetterCal is an examle of what we have created, and it has been well received among its target user base. Filled with rich features like event reports, and the ability to view all your events and contacts on a map, and simple drag and drop events - users have been thrilled by the simplicity and streamlined integration with existing services. Reach out for more information.</p>
